Project from the class of June 11, 2018, which performs mathematical problems with numbers supplied from the user. 

There is one bug left to resolve: How do I disallow user from entering nonnumbers? The good news is I have disallowed attempts to divide by zero.

The user gets to choose whether to multiply, subtract, multiply or divide, and he will be steered to the appropriate function. If user makes a typo, he will get another chance, using the repeat function.

At the end of the computation, the user will be steered to the repeat function, where he will be asked if he wants to do another computation. The typo protection will remain, and the user may decline another computation and exit the procedure.
